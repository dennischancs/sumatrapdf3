<h1>Genius PDF is a SumatraPDF ripoff</h1>

<p>Some people take <a href="/">SumatraPDF's code</a>,
rename it, bundle additional crappy software and distribute it.</p>

<p>Genius PDF is one of those programs. It's a Sumatra rip-off and you shouldn't
be using it.</p>

<p>We, the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/source/browse/trunk/AUTHORS">SumatraPDF developers</a>,
do all the hard, <a href="https://code.google.com/p/sumatrapdf/source/list">on-going work</a> behind the app.</p>

<p>We provide <a href="/manual.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>We provide
<a href="/forum.html">support</a>.</p>

<p>The ripoff artists that use our work do none of those things.</p>

<p>All you get is questionable software installed on your computer
alongside the app that is merely renamed SumatraPDF.</p>

<p>Unless you want your computer to be infested with malware, unwanted
browser toolbars etc., use the original <a href="/">SumatraPDF</a>, downloaded from
our <a href="/download-free-pdf-viewer.html">official website</a>.
</p>

<p>As an additional slap in the face, they have the gall to ask for
donations, so that you can give them money for the code that I wrote.
